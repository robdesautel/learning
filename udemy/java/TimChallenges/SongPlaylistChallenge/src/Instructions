Create a program that implements a playlist for songs.
Create a Song class having Title and duration for a song.
The program will han an Album class containing a list of songs.
The albums will be stored in an ArrayList.
Songs from different albums an be added to the playlist and will appear in the list in the order
they are added.
Once the songs have been added to the playlist, create a menu options to:
Quit
Skip Forward
Skip backwards
Replay current song
List the songs in the playlist
A song must exist in an album before it can be added to the playlist(so you can only play songs that
you own.)
Hint: To replay a song, consider what happened when we went back and forth from a city before we
started tracking the direction we were going.
As an optional extra, provide an option to remove the current song from the playlist
hint: listiterator.remove()
