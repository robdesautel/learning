Your job is to create a simple banking application.
There should be a Bank class
It should have an arraylist of Branches
Each Branch should have an arraylist of Customers
The Customer class should have an arraylist of doubles (transactions)
Customer:
    name(first, last)
    arraylist of doubles
Branch:
    add new customer with initial transaction(deposit)
    add additional transactions for that customer/branch (Loans?)
Bank:
    add new branch
    add a customer to a branch with initial transaction
    add a transaction for an existing customer for that branch.
    show a list of customers for a particular branch and optionally a list
    of their transactions.
Demonstration autoboxing and unboxing in your code.
Hint:
Transaction
add data validation.
e.g. check if exists, or doe not exist, etc.
Think about where you are adding the code to perform certain actions.
