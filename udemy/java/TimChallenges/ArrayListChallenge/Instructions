Create a program that implements a single mobile phone with the following capabilities.
Able to store, modify, remove and query contact items.
You will want to create a separate class for Contacts (name and phone number).
Create a master class (MobilePhone) that holds the ArrayList of Contacts
The MobilePHone class has the functionality listed above.
Add a menu of options that are available.
Option: Quit, print list of contacts, add new contact, update existing contact, remove contact
and search/find contact.
When adding or updating be sure to check if the contact already exists (use name)
e.g. no ints, no .get(i), etc..
MobilePhone should do everything with contacts objects only.
