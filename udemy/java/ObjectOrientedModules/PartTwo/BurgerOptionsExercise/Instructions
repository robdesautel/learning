The purpose of the application is to help a fictitious company called Bills Burgers to manage
their process of selling hamburgers.
Our application will help Bill to select types of burgers, some of the additional items (additions) to
be added to the burgers and pricing.

We want to create a base hamburger, but also two other types of hamburgers that are popular ones in
Bills store.

Create a Hamburger class
The basic hamburger should have the following items that the customer can select to be added to the burger:
bread roll type
meat
up to 4 additional additions (things like lettuce, tomato, carrot, etc)

Each one of these items gets charged an additional
price so you need some way to track how many items got added and to calculate the price (for the base
burger and all the additions).
The constructor should only include the roll type, meat, and price.
This burger has a base price and the additions are all separately priced.

Also create two extra varieties of Hamburgers (classes) to cater for
a) Healthy burger
on a brown rye bread roll
plus two additional items can be added.
The healthy burger can have a total of 6 items (Additions) in total.
hint: you probably want to process the 2 additional items in this new class not the base class,
since the 2 additions are only appropriate for this new class.

b) Deluxe hamburger comes with
chips
drinks
no extra additions are allowed.
hint: you have to find a way to automatically add these new additions at the time the deluxe burger
object is created, and then prevent other additions being made.

All 3 classes should
have a method that can be called anytime to show the base price of the hamburger
all additions (each showing the addition name)
and addition price
and a grand total for the
burger.

For the two additional classes this may require you to be looking at the base class for pricing and then
adding totals onto that.
